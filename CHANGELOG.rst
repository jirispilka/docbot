Guiding Principles
------------------

- Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
- There should be an entry for every single version.
- The same types of changes should be grouped.
- Versions and sections should be linkable.
- The latest version comes first.
- The release date of each version is displayed.
- Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

Types of Changes
----------------

- ``Features/Enhancements`` for new features.
- ``Bug Fixes`` for any bug fixes.
- ``Docs`` for updating documentation.
- ``Other`` for everything else.

Versioning
----------

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

- ``MAJOR`` version when you make incompatible API changes,
- ``MINOR`` version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
- ``PATCH`` version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
